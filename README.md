# Data Science Portfolio

This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Machine Learning
	
	- [Notebook House Prices](https://github.com/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Portfolio_-_House_Prices_Vs1.ipynb): This is a Kaggle platform competition, available at [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). From a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, challenges to predict the final price of each home.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, XGBRegressor and scikit-learn regressors_
	
	_Skills: Linear Regression_

	
	- [Notebook Wine Quality](https://github.com/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Wine.ipynb): These datasets are available from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality), and are a paper of [Cortez et al., 2009] called **Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.**
