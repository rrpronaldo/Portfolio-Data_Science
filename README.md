# Data Science Portfolio

This repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Contents

- ### Deep Learning
	
	- [Coloring black and white images](https://github.com/rrpronaldo/colorful_image_colorization): Image colorization is the process of taking an input grayscale (black and white) image and then producing an output colorized image. The main purpose of this is to color some pictures of my grandfather.

	_Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, Pytorch_
	
	_Skills: Neural Networks, Deep Learning_

- ### Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Machine Learning
	
	- [Notebook House Prices](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Portfolio_-_House_Prices_Vs1.ipynb): This is a Kaggle platform competition, available at [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). From a dataset with 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, challenges to predict the final price of each home.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, XGBRegressor and scikit-learn regressors_
	
	_Skills: Linear Regression_

	
	- [Notebook Wine Quality](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Wine.ipynb): These datasets are available from the [UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality), and are a paper of [Cortez et al., 2009] called **Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties.** 

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow, XGBClassifier, SVMClassifier and Random Forest Classifier_
	
	_Skills: Data Visualization, Data Classification_
	
	- [Notebook Enem 2016](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Codenation_Enem_1_Colab.ipynb): This is a Codenation challenge, available at [Codenation](https://www.codenation.dev/aceleradev/ds-online-1/challenge/enem-ps). From a dataset with student scores, create a model to predict the math test score for those who participated in the ENEM 2016 exam.

	_Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, XGBRegressor and PyDrive_
	
	_Skills: Linear Regression, Missing Values_
	
	- [Notebook Leads](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Codenation_Final.ipynb): This is the notebook for Codenation's final Data Science Acceleration project, the goal of the challenge is to provide an automated service that recommends leads (new customers) to a user, given their current customer list (portfolio).

	_Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Folium, NearestNeighbors_
	
	_Skills: Clustering, Recommendation System, Missing Values_


- ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Notebook MercadoLivre Challenge 2019](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rrpronaldo/Portfolio-Data_Science/blob/master/Portfolio_-_Mercado_Livre_Vs_2.ipynb): Train a machine learning model to categorize to product publications based on their titles.


	_Tools: Tensorflow, NLTK, scikit, keras_
	
	_Skills: Word Embeeding, Word Stemmer, Vectorizer, TF-IDF,
